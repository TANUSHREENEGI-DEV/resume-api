# resume-api

This is the backend for **ResumeFlow**, my AI resume builder project. It's a REST API built with Express that handles everything from auth to documents to a mock AI layer — and now it actually saves data instead of forgetting everything the moment the server restarts.

I built this as part of my Full Stack internship (Module 4, Day 13-14). Earlier version had all the routes working but data only lived in memory. This version fixes that — every write goes to `data.json` on disk, for real.

---

## What it does

- User auth (register/login/logout, mock password reset)
- User profile management
- Full document CRUD — resumes can have sections, and sections can have items (like experience entries), plus a version history so you can roll back edits
- A templates list to pick a resume layout
- A mock AI layer (bullet point rewriting, summaries) that spends "AI credits"
- A job application tracker (company, role, status)

---

## Tech stack

- **Node.js + Express** — the server
- **`data.json`** — file-based storage, no real database yet
- **Postman** — for testing routes manually

## How persistence actually works

This was the whole point of this update. `db.js` keeps one in-memory copy of `data.json`, and every single route that changes something calls `db.save()` right after, which writes the whole object back to disk.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Route as Route Handler
    participant DB as db.js
    participant File as data.json

    Client->>Route: POST /api/applications
    Route->>DB: db.data.applications.push(newApp)
    Route->>DB: db.save()
    DB->>File: fs.writeFileSync(data)
    File-->>DB: written
    DB-->>Route: done
    Route-->>Client: 201 Created + new application
```

No route is allowed to mutate `db.data` and skip the save step — that was the bug in the earlier version.

## Data model

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +string id
        +string name
        +string email
        +string password
        +string tier
        +number aiCredits
    }

    class Document {
        +string id
        +string userId
        +string title
        +string type
        +string templateId
        +Section[] sections
        +Version[] versions
    }

    class Section {
        +string id
        +string type
        +string title
        +number order
        +Item[] items
    }

    class Item {
        +string id
        +string role
        +string company
        +string description
    }

    class Version {
        +string id
        +string createdAt
        +Section[] snapshot
    }

    class Application {
        +string id
        +string userId
        +string company
        +string role
        +string status
    }

    User "1" --> "many" Document
    Document "1" --> "many" Section
    Section "1" --> "many" Item
    Document "1" --> "many" Version
    User "1" --> "many" Application
```

## Document version lifecycle

A document doesn't just get overwritten when you edit it — you can save a version snapshot and restore it later if you mess something up.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Versioned: save version
    Versioned --> Draft: continue editing
    Draft --> Restored: restore old version
    Restored --> Draft: continue editing
    Draft --> [*]: delete document
```

## API routes

### Auth (`/api/auth`)

## Running it locally

```bash
npm install
node app.js
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:3000`. There's no real login yet — every request is treated as the seed user (`u1`) in `data.json`, through `middleware/mockAuth.js`. Real auth is a later module.

Test it with Postman or `Invoke-RestMethod` (curl gets weird with quotes in PowerShell, learned that the hard way):

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/applications" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"company":"Google","role":"SWE Intern"}'
```

Then check `data.json` — the new entry should be sitting right there, saved on disk, not just in memory.

## Tested and working

Ran every route through Postman before calling this done — here's proof the persistence actually works.

**GET `/api/documents`** — returns the seed document, confirming the server reads from `data.json` correctly:

**POST `/api/applications`** — created a new job application, got back a clean `201 Created`. Checked `data.json` right after and the entry was sitting there on disk, not just in memory:

Built this one route at a time, testing persistence properly this time instead of assuming it worked. Next up: replacing the mock auth with real JWT-based sessions. 🌸
